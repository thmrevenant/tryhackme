What type of protocol is SMB?    
response-request

What do clients connect to servers using?    
TCP/IP

What systems does Samba run on?
Unix

Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?
3

What ports is SMB running on?
139/445

Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?    
WORKGROUP

What comes up as the name of the machine?        
POLOSMB

What operating system version is running?    
6.1

What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?    
profiles

What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445

Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?
Y

Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?
John Cactus

What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?
ssh

Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?
.ssh

This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. Which of these keys is most useful to us?
id_rsa

What is the smb.txt flag?
THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}

What is Telnet?    
application protocol

What has slowly replaced Telnet?    
ssh

How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?
telnet 10.10.10.3 23

The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?
encryption

How many ports are open on the target machine?    
1

What port is this?
8012

This port is unassigned, but still lists the protocol it's using, what protocol is this?     
tcp

Now re-run the nmap scan, without the -p- tag, how many ports show up as open?
0

Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be used for?
a backdoor

Who could it belong to? Gathering possible usernames is an important step in enumeration.
Skidy

Great! It's an open telnet connection! What welcome message do we receive?
SKIDY'S BACKDOOR.

Let's try executing some commands, do we get a return on any input we enter into the telnet session? (Y/N)
N

Now, use the command "ping [local THM ip] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with .RUN (Y/N)
Y

What word does the generated payload start with?
mkfifo

What would the command look like for the listening port we selected in our payload?
nc -lvnp 4444

Success! What is the contents of flag.txt?
THM{y0u_g0t_th3_t3ln3t_fl4g}

What communications model does FTP use?
client-server

What's the standard FTP port?
21

How many modes of FTP connection are there?    
2

How many ports are open on the target machine? 
2

What port is ftp running on?
21

What variant of FTP is running on it?  
vsftpd

What is the name of the file in the anonymous FTP directory?
PUBLIC_NOTICE.txt

What do we think a possible username
could be?
mike

What is the password for the user "mike"?
password

What is ftp.txt?
THM{y0u_g0t_th3_ftp_fl4g}
