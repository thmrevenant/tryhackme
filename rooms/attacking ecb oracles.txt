In what year did NIST hold a competition to find a new encryption algorithm that correctly implemented the three fundamental rules of cryptography?
1997

What is the AES cipher otherwise known as?
Rijndael Cipher

What type of encryption is AES? (Symmetric/Asymmetric)
Symmetric

What is used when the last AES block of the original message isn't completely filled?
padding

What is the ciphertext when encrypting the message CryptographyAndADreamToSecurity using the secret NotAGreatSecret!?
c35a97106295a3101b6be8a9af954d198462b30f0af7f669d46766cbeea7eabf

What cipher principle does ECB not perform sufficiently, leading to it being vulnerable?
diffusion

What types of files are notoriously difficult for ECB to encrypt?
images

What do we need to determine in the first step to attack an ECB oracle?
Block Size

What is the second element that we need to determine to attack an ECB oracle?
Offset

Using the script, what is the first character that is leaked from the oracle?
O

Now for the challenge, upgrade the script to recover the entire secret from the oracle. What is this secret?
