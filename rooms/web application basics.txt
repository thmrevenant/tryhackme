Which component acts as a protective layer, filtering incoming traffic to block malicious attacks, and ensuring the security of the the web application?
web application firewall

Which protocol provides encrypted communication to ensure secure data transmission between a web browser and a web server?
HTTPS

What term describes the practice of registering domain names that are misspelt variations of popular websites to exploit user errors and potentially engage in fraudulent activities?
Typosquatting

What part of a URL is used to pass additional information, such as search terms or form inputs, to the web server?
Query String

Which HTTP message is returned by the web server after processing a client's request?
HTTP response

What follows the headers in an HTTP message?
Empty Line

Which HTTP protocol version became widely adopted and remains the most commonly used version for web communication, known for introducing features like persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding?
HTTP/1.1

Which HTTP request method describes the communication options for the target resource, allowing clients to determine which HTTP methods are supported by the web server?
OPTIONS

In an HTTP request, which component specifies the specific resource or endpoint on the web server that the client is requesting, typically appearing after the domain name in the URL?
URL Path

Which HTTP request header specifies the domain name of the web server to which the request is being sent?
Host

What is the default content type for form submissions in an HTTP request where the data is encoded as key=value pairs in a query string format?
application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Which part of an HTTP request contains additional information like host, user agent, and content type, guiding how the web server should process the request?
Request Headers

What part of an HTTP response provides the HTTP version, status code, and a brief explanation of the response's outcome?

Server Error Responses

Which HTTP status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the web server?

Secure

Which flag should be added to cookies in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header to prevent them from being accessed via JavaScript, thereby enhancing security against XSS attacks?

includeSubDomains

Which HTTP header directive is used to prevent browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified by the server, thereby mitigating content type sniffing attacks?
